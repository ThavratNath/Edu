
'''Comparision operator''''''We use it when we want a group of code to be printed'''
'''Example: 
- >, <, >=, <=
- == : when the two value is the same on the left and the right side is the same. 
- = : is called the assignment operator. We give the value to the variable
Ex: 2==2: true
    x = 2: x'''
    
# print(f"10>3 is {10>3}.")
# print(f"3<7 is {3<7}.")
# print(f"5==5 is {5==5}.")

# print(f"7<=9 is {7<=9}.")
# print(f"3!=4 is {3!=4}.")
